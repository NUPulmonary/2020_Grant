# Alveolitis in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is driven by self-sustaining circuits between infected alveolar macrophages and T cells

The Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) systems biology center is a multi-investigator collaborative group led by Dr. Richard Wunderink and supported by a collaborative U19 award from the NIAID (https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9843971&icde=51116520&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=3&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=).    
   
The purpose of SCRIPT is to identify host and pathogen factors that predict successful or failed therapy for pneumonia with a goal of identifying novel targets for therapy.  In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, SCRIPT has shifted its focus to patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, defined as those requiring mechanical ventilation. We are able to compare those patients with patients in SCRIPT who have pneumonia secondary to other pathogens. 
This page contains de-identified data from our published manuscripts that can be explored using intuitive tools.    
   
SCRIPT is a multidisciplinary effort that involves investigators across disciplines at Northwestern. We are proud to have more than 100 contributing authors to our publications all of whom are dedicated to improving the care of patients with pneumonia and meeting the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic (PUT LINK HERE).
